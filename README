Program Analysis based on LLVM and Clang

# Setup Build Environment
1. build llvm and clang
 - currently, the project is only tested under llvm-3.3 and clang-3.3, you'd better stick to that release version
 - build llvm and clang under the instruction here "http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html"

2. setup the build envrionment for our project
 - move the build directory of llvm to project's root directory, and rename it to "llvm-build"

After that, your directory should look like this.

|-- include
|   `-- analyzer.h
|-- llvm-build
|   |-- bindings
|   |-- docs
|   |-- examples
|   |-- include
|   |-- lib
|   |-- Makefile
|   |-- projects
|   |-- Release+Asserts
|   |-- runtime
|   |-- test
|   |-- tools
|   |-- unittests
|   `-- utils
|-- Makefile
|-- README
|-- samples
|   |-- build
|   |-- CMakeLists.txt
|   |-- compile_commands.json
|   |-- main.cpp
|   |-- Makefile
|   `-- sample
`-- src
    |-- analyzer.cpp
    `-- main.cpp

Make sure that there's a "Release+Asserts" directory under "llvm-build" which contains header files and libraries.

 - invoke `make`	(clang++ is needed to compile the source code)
 - done
